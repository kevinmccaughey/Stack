# DEPRECATED: I have switched to Ruby/Rails - see VladGH.com for this source #



EDIT: Package edited by Kevin MCCaughey (http://www.kevinmccaughey.org/?p=117)
I have added PostgreSQL integration instead of MySQL and have experimental functions for
automating firewall, fail2ban and SSH setup for a full server ready to port into
(these are under construction. UFW works but SSH sed is wrong, so commented both out)
It may be easier for anyone using this to go to Vlad's source and edit from there!
I will update again once I get the SSH working, some time Feb 2012


## What follows is the original comment from Vlad: ##

This package represents a script to install the latest NginX, MySQL and PHP (with APC and Suhosin):

  * NginX 1.1.14 stable
  * PHP 5.3.9
  * APC 3.1.9
  * Suhosin Extension 0.9.33

All the steps are described at http://vladgh.com/blog/install-nginx-and-php-php-fpm-mysql-and-apc
It's highly recommended to run this installer on a fresh installed system.
This is tested with Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04, both 32 bits and 64 bits, on official Amazon EC2 Ubuntu images.

# HOW TO: #

Make sure you have Git installed on your Ubuntu System:

    sudo apt-get install git-core screen

Clone this repository, and get the latest stable version of this script:

    git clone git://github.com/vladgh/VladGh.com-LEMP.git
    cd VladGh.com-LEMP

Run the installer; I recommend running everything inside a screen session because if your connection drops you can easily come back with `screen -rad`

    sudo screen ./install.sh

If you need an earlier version checkout the appropriate tag before running the install script:
  
    git checkout 2.3

After the installer is finished (this will take a long time depending on your server specifications), you can go to your servers address and you will see the PHP info page.
Also, if you go to:

  * **http://example.com/apc.php** you will find the APC Cache information page;
  * **http://example.com/nginx_status** for the NginX statistics;
  * **http://example.com/status?html** for the FPM statistics. 

# Utilities: #
In the "ext" folder you will also find some utilities:

* `nxensite` and `nxdissite` commands to enable or disable sites in NginX (similar to a2ensite and a2dissite in Apache).
* `update_nginx.sh` script which can upgrade the current nginx.
	* you can run it with `sudo env PATH=$PATH ext/update_nginx.sh 1.0.4` (as you can see there are a few things worth mentioning: you need to declare the current path to the sudo command in order to preserve it; you can only have one argument in a strict form x.x.x; )
	* this script is doing nothing more than reconstructing you current nginx config with the new version. It gets the previous configure options programmatically so if you used 3rd party modules it will not work. Also it saves the current config files and brings them back after the compilation was successful.
